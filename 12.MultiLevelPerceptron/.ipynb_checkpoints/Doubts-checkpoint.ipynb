    "#### Forward Propagation\n",
    "- In forward propagation, the input data is passed through the neural network layer by layer from the input layer to the output layer.\n",
    "- At each layer, the activations are computed based on the input data, weights, and biases using predefined activation functions (e.g., sigmoid, ReLU).\n",
    "- The output of the final layer is the predicted output of the neural network.\n",
    "- Forward propagation is used to make predictions given input data without adjusting any parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Backward Propagation\n",
    "- In backward propagation (also known as backpropagation), the error between the predicted output and the actual target is calculated using a loss function (e.g., mean squared error, cross-entropy).\n",
    "- The goal of backward propagation is to adjust the weights and biases of the neural network to minimize this error.\n",
    "- Backward propagation involves computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters (weights and biases) of the neural network using the chain rule of calculus.\n",
    "- These gradients are then used to update the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient to minimize the loss function.\n",
    "- Backward propagation is essentially the process of propagating the error backward through the network to adjust the parameters to improve the model's performance."
